# Abizar - A7 Catification

My catification algorithm creates donuts that look like people.

Sliders: 
- colorHue, colorSaturation, colorLightness: HSL color of the donut icing
- limbLength: length of donut's legs
- donutHeight: height of donut
- donutWidth: width of donut
- holeSize: size of hole inside donut
- toppingPatternSeed: a seed value that controls the pseudo-randomization algorithm that draws the topping

I plan to continue building this in the future by adding:
1. one bite mark in the donut, with eyes/ears/legs removed from the area overlapping the bite mark
2. sprinkles on the donut
