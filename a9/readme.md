# Abizar - A9

For A9, I made a simple ghost mask that uses opacity tricks to create
interesting effects.

Sliders:
- faceColor: sets a color scheme to use for circles on the face
- faceCirclesSize: controls the size of the circles drawn on the face
- faceFuzziness: controls the opacity of each circle drawn on the face
- trail: changes whether we leave a trail behind us (by adjusting background opacity)
- fingerTipMotion: controls the random motion created on the fingertip
