# Abizar - A5 Chatbot

Welcome, and I hope you enjoy interacting with me, a Silicon Valley
software engineering intern!

- Life: if you include any generic words like life, hi, ok, yes, or what's up,
I will give a little life update.
- Help: If you include the word help, issue, or problem, I
will share one of my problems at work.
- Startup: If you include the word startup, mission, or goal, I 
  will share one of my billion dollar startup ideas.
