# Abizar A6: Simulation Argument

The argument I was trying to make was that virtual mentorship would be better than in-person mentorship because
once we freed ourselves of the neighborhood constraints of matching we could make better matches.

My simulator succeeds in that, between the first (in-person) and second (virtual) exploration, we do see a 
considerable increase both in the darkness we can visualize and in the skill gained that I write after the
simulation.

My simulator failed in that, in the third exploration in which we add the criteria the virtual format of 
mentorship is not as effective for a single mentor-mentee pair as in-person (which I do believe is true),
the simulation didn't show as impressive results.

Reflecting on this experience, I think these explorations were a really good first step, but to 
model this phenomena more closely and make a better argument I would have to use a more sophisticated
representation and visualization than a cellular automata. Or I'd have to think of other creative ways
of representing this within the cellular automata!
