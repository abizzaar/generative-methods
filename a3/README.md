# A3: Drawing Tool

Note: The code is pretty messy. I wouldn't try to understand the minor details. Just read the readme.

For reviewers: I've used SVGs to add the icons onto the screen, and I used p5 to render the splatter effect under the icon. It's pretty hacky and I wouldn't do it again. I was just exploring and somehow landed up here.

Thanks to Please.js for helping me generate such sick color combinations. And p5.js and Ionicons.
